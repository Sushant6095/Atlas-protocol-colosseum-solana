# Atlas Frontend — Part 1: Spine (design + motion + perf)

Phase 20 lands the spine. Parts 2–5 (Phases 21–24) layer routing +
state, intelligence surfaces, operator surfaces, and viz / realtime
distribution on top, reusing every token and budget below.

## What Phase 20 ships

| Layer | Code |
|---|---|
| Design tokens (color / type / space / radius / motion / budgets) | [web/lib/tokens.ts](web/lib/tokens.ts) |
| CSS variable bridge + reduced-motion contract | [web/app/globals.css](web/app/globals.css) |
| Motion library (framer-motion variants tokenised) | [web/lib/motion.ts](web/lib/motion.ts) |
| Realtime transport — single multiplexed WebSocket | [web/lib/realtime/transport.ts](web/lib/realtime/transport.ts) |
| Realtime store — RAF-batched, dedup'd, backpressured | [web/lib/realtime/store.ts](web/lib/realtime/store.ts) + [hooks.ts](web/lib/realtime/hooks.ts) |
| 3D scene supervisor — viewport mount + adaptive FPS + LOD + low-end freeze | [web/lib/three/supervisor.ts](web/lib/three/supervisor.ts) |
| Perf telemetry — Web Vitals + long-task + memory + render counter | [web/lib/perf/](web/lib/perf/) |
| State contract — TanStack Query defaults + Zustand UI registry | [web/lib/state/](web/lib/state/) |
| Primitive components (memoised) — Panel, Button, IdentifierMono, AlertPill, Tile | [web/components/primitives/](web/components/primitives/) |
| ESLint guard — block raw hex, banned state libs, framer-motion sub-paths | [web/eslint.config.mjs](web/eslint.config.mjs) |

## The design system

### Five accent colors. That's it.

| Token | Use |
|---|---|
| `electric` (`#3F8CFF`) | primary action, focus rings |
| `zk` (`#A682FF`) | proof / zk surfaces |
| `proof` (`#F478C6`) | proof events |
| `execute` (`#3CE39A`) | execution success, "good" SLO |
| `warn` (`#F7B955`) / `danger` (`#FF6166`) | warning / error states |

Adding a sixth requires a written rationale and a `tokens.ts` PR.
ESLint rejects any raw hex outside [tokens.ts](web/lib/tokens.ts).

### Three font families. Three only.

`Cabinet Grotesk` (display) · `Geist` (body) · `IBM Plex Mono`
(identifiers, hashes, addresses, basis-point figures, code).

Self-hosted. No Google Fonts CDN. ESLint blocks `**/google-fonts/**`
imports.

### 4px grid. Three densities.

`dense` (16/24) for terminals + tables. `default` (24/40) for
intelligence + content. `cinematic` (80/120) for landing.

### Four easings. Five durations.

`glide` / `precise` / `expressive` / `inertial` ×
`instant` (60ms) / `quick` (140ms) / `medium` (220ms) / `slow` (340ms) /
`cinema` (720ms). Anything > 400ms is reviewed in PR.

## The performance architecture

### Render budgets

| Surface class | LCP | INP | CLS |
|---|---|---|---|
| Marketing | ≤ 1.8s | ≤ 200ms | ≤ 0.05 |
| Intelligence | ≤ 2.4s | ≤ 200ms | ≤ 0.05 |
| Operator | ≤ 2.8s | ≤ 200ms | ≤ 0.02 |

Bundles (gzip): initial ≤ 220 KB · per-route split ≤ 120 KB · 3D
import ≤ 380 KB · first interaction ≤ 600 KB.

### Realtime contract

One WebSocket per session, multiplexed by topic. Topics auto-pause
within 1.5s of leaving the viewport. Events deduped via a
4096-entry LRU on `event_id = blake3(canonical_bytes)`. Out-of-order
tolerated up to 32-deep. The store flushes on
`requestAnimationFrame`, not per-event — a 200-tick burst becomes
one render.

Backpressure: at 1024 buffered events the store drops oldest
*non-critical* ticks; alerts, rebalance events, and PER session
events are never dropped. After three reconnect failures the UI
surfaces a non-blocking "live updates paused" pill in the corner.

```ts
import { initRealtime, useRealtimeSnapshot, useRealtimeStream } from "@/lib/realtime";

initRealtime({ url: "wss://atlas.example/api/v1/stream", token });

const tps = useRealtimeSnapshot<TpsTick>("stream.infra.tps"); // RAF-flushed snapshot
useRealtimeStream<RebalanceEvent>("stream.vault.0xab12.rebalance", (e) => {
  // hot path — no rerender of the calling component
});
```

### 3D scene supervisor

```ts
const sceneRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
const { mounted, updateMultiplier, lod, freeze } = useSceneSupervisor(sceneRef, { surface: "landing" });
```

- `mounted` flips on viewport intersection (rootMargin 200px).
- `updateMultiplier` drops from 1 → 0.5 when frame time exceeds
  22ms for > 1s, returns to 1 when comfortably under 18ms for > 1s.
- `lod` returns `tier1 / tier2 / tier3` based on canvas pixel count.
- `freeze` is true under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` or
  low-end devices (< 4 cores or < 4 GB memory). Render the first
  frame and stop.

Operator surfaces are forced to `mounted = false` — the budget is
too tight for 3D in a terminal.

### State stores — three, no more

1. **Server cache** — TanStack Query (live `staleTime: 5_000`,
   archival `staleTime: 60_000`). Vault-scoped query keys via
   `vaultKey(id, …rest)` so invalidation is explicit.
2. **Realtime cache** — Zustand slice fed by the WebSocket
   multiplexer. Components subscribe via per-topic selectors.
3. **UI state** — Zustand slices per feature. The registry at
   [registry.ts](web/lib/state/registry.ts) is documentation;
   ESLint blocks Redux / Recoil / Jotai imports.

### Memory + lifecycle hygiene

Every WebSocket subscription returns an unsubscribe. Every RAF
registration is cancelled on unmount. IntersectionObserver /
ResizeObserver / MutationObserver disconnected on unmount. r3f
scenes call `.dispose()` on geometries / materials / textures /
renderers when the root unmounts. The dev-only memory inspector
warns on monotonic heap growth across navigations.

## What's deliberately not here

- A sixth accent color "for one screen". The palette is fixed.
- A new font family "for marketing". Three families.
- Auto-playing 3D scenes outside the viewport.
- A component that subscribes to a WebSocket AND renders a 3D
  scene AND mutates global state. Split it.
- An animation library imported globally just to use one easing
  curve. Use [tokens.ts](web/lib/tokens.ts).
- Server components that import client-only modules. The boundary
  is enforced.
- Dropping motion accessibility because "the demo needs to look
  cool". `prefers-reduced-motion` collapses every transition above
  `quick` to instant.

## What's next

| Phase | Adds |
|---|---|
| 21 ✅ | Application shell · routing · auth · state architecture |
| 22 | Intelligence surfaces (capital flow heatmap, /infra observatory, exposure graph) |
| 23 | Operator surfaces (vault terminal, command palette, pending queue, agent dashboard) |
| 24 | 3D + viz + distribution (landing globe, zk-proof geometry, force-directed exposure graph, embedded widgets) |

Every one of those parts will reuse Phase 20's tokens and budgets
without exception. A surface that violates Phase 20 is a surface
that does not ship.

# Frontend Part 2 — Application Shell, Routing, Auth, State (Phase 21)

Phase 20 was the spine. Phase 21 wires the route map, the five
shells, the auth flow, the data plane, and the cross-cutting chrome
(palette, alert center, keyboard shortcuts).

## Route map

Eight route groups, each owning a shell. Existing flat routes
(`/`, `/vaults`, `/markets`, `/proofs`, `/how-it-works`) keep their
legacy `<Navbar />` until Phase 22's migration; new routes use the
group shells exclusively.

| Group | Shell | Routes |
|---|---|---|
| `(marketing)` | MarketingShell | `/architecture` · `/security` · `/legal` |
| `(public)` | PublicShell | `/infra` · `/proofs/live` · `/decision-engine` |
| `(intel)` | IntelligenceShell | `/intelligence` · `/wallet-intelligence` · `/market` · `/risk` |
| `(operator)` | TerminalShell | `/vault/[id]/...` · `/rebalance/live` · `/triggers` · `/recurring` · `/hedging` |
| `(treasury)` | TerminalShell | `/treasury/...` (overview, ledger, runway, invoices, payments, proofs, pending, confidential) |
| `(governance)` | TerminalShell | `/governance/...` (models, agents) |
| `(docs)` | DocsShell | `/docs` · `/docs/api` · `/docs/sdk` · `/docs/shortcuts` · `/playground` · `/webhooks` |
| `(account)` | IntelligenceShell | `/account/...` (devices, viewing-keys, preferences) |

## SDK + queryKeys

[lib/sdk/client.ts](web/lib/sdk/client.ts) is the single API client.
The Phase 21 ESLint rule blocks `fetch("/api/v1/...")` everywhere
except the BFF and the SDK wrapper itself. The
[queryKeys factory](web/lib/sdk/queryKeys.ts) is the only place a
TanStack Query key is constructed — scoped invalidation comes for
free (`queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: queryKeys.vault(id).rebalances() })`
touches one vault, never the whole app).

## Auth — Sign-In With Solana

Three-step BFF exchange at
[/api/v1/auth/{challenge,verify,refresh,session,signout}](web/app/api/v1/auth/):

1. `POST /challenge` — server-issued nonce + scoped cookie
2. wallet `signMessage` over the canonical SIWS payload
3. `POST /verify` — JWT issued, set as `httpOnly + Secure +
   SameSite=Strict` cookie

[useSession()](web/lib/auth/useSession.ts) exposes the in-memory
mirror plus scope helpers (`isVaultMember(id)`,
`treasuryRoleAtLeast(id, "FinanceAdmin")`, `isAuditor(policyId)`).
The JWT itself never lives in localStorage.

## Viewing-key vault

[lib/viewing-keys/vault.ts](web/lib/viewing-keys/vault.ts) ships
the encrypted IndexedDB pattern: AES-GCM ciphertext at rest, a
CryptoKey derived via PBKDF2 from `wallet_signature || passphrase`,
auto-locks 10 minutes after the tab leaves the foreground.
Plaintext exists only in the in-memory `unlocked` map; the API
surfaces `getPlaintext(id)` for transient reads. The server never
sees a viewing key.

## Command palette + keyboard shortcuts

⌘K opens [CommandPalette](web/components/command-palette/CommandPalette.tsx);
the catalog at [commands.ts](web/components/command-palette/commands.ts)
covers every named route. Cross-route shortcuts (`g v`, `g t`,
`g i`, `g d`, `g r`, `⌘ .`, `?`) are wired by
[KeyboardShortcuts](web/components/command-palette/KeyboardShortcuts.tsx);
the printable cheat sheet ships at `/docs/shortcuts`.

## System components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Skeleton`, `SkeletonText`, `SkeletonRow`, `SkeletonChart` | layout-preserving loaders |
| `EmptyState` | one-sentence description + CTA + doc link |
| `InlineErrorPill` | panel-level fallback with retry |
| `RouteErrorBoundary` | route-level fallback with copyable trace id |
| `LiveStatusPill` | live / connecting / degraded / closed pill wired to the realtime store |
| `AlertCenter` | flyout list backed by `stream.*.alert` topics; flag for first-open before any push prompt |

## Lint additions

Raw `fetch("/api/v1/*")` blocked outside `app/api/**`,
`lib/sdk/client.ts`, `lib/realtime/**`, `lib/auth/siws.ts`, and
`app/providers.tsx`. Phase 20's token + state library blocks remain
in force.

# Frontend Part 3 — Marketing, Public Observability, Intelligence (Phase 22)

Phase 21 wired the spine; Phase 22 fills the surfaces a first-time
visitor sees. Each one establishes credibility before login.

## Owned routes

| Surface | What it ships |
|---|---|
| `/` | Hero + lattice · live counters · 8-stage proof lifecycle · trust columns (I-1…I-25) · live rebalance feed · protocols · architecture teaser · API CTA |
| `/architecture` | Interactive blueprint (`SystemDiagram`) — 26 nodes, 24 edges, hover surfaces files + invariants, "play story" walks one rebalance |
| `/security` | Research-paper layout: invariants, primitives, public input layouts, 8 chaos game days, audit history, bug bounty |
| `/legal` | Custody, privacy, compliance, disclosure — plain language |
| `/infra` | 12-panel observatory wired to `/api/v1/infra` (5s refetch): tier-A/B latency, quorum match, slot lag, attribution heatmap, TPS, Jito, validator latency, CU, proof gen, rebalance e2e, Pyth post, freshness budget |
| `/proofs/live` | Active sessions carousel + recent verifications table + drilldown with "verify in browser" |
| `/decision-engine` | Featured rebalance (Why · Who · How) + filterable list (regime / veto / defensive) |
| `/wallet-intelligence` | Paste address → 700 ms report (balances, exposure, behaviour, risk score, three recommendations); QVAC privacy-mode toggle |
| `/intelligence` | Capital flow heatmap (asset × protocol × direction with provenance pills) + exposure graph (wallet → protocol → asset, weighted) |
| `/market` | Stablecoin flows · yield spreads · smart-money cohorts · live signal stream |
| `/risk` | Risk topology · vault risk radar · liquidity-collapse simulator · oracle deviation · vol surface |
| `/docs` | Getting started · concepts · cookbook · references |
| `/playground` | Three-pane interactive console (catalog · request · response) with replay-mode toggle and TS / Rust / curl snippets |
| `/governance` | Pending votes + KPIs |
| `/governance/models` | Model registry with status pills + lineage |
| `/governance/agents` | Phase 15 keeper roster with ratcheted-usage progress + Squads renew CTA |

## Narrative primitives

`web/components/narrative/` ships the shared building blocks every
public surface reaches for:

- `LiveCounter` — RAF-tweened mono numeric.
- `ProofLifecycle` — 8-stage SVG diagram with autoplay or focused
  highlight; tooltip surfaces each stage's SLO budget.
- `LiveRebalanceFeed` — auto-scrolling ticker reading from
  `stream.vault.*.rebalance`; falls back to a synthetic seed when no
  WebSocket is configured.
- `ProvenancePill` — every cell in `/intelligence` and `/market`
  ships one of these (warehouse / dune / rpc-fast / synth).
- `RegimeBadge` — `risk_on / neutral / defensive / crisis`.
- `HeroLattice` — pure-CSS / SVG proof lattice for the landing hero
  (Phase 24 swaps in the r3f globe).

## Surface-specific components

- `architecture/SystemDiagram` + `nodes.ts` — hand-laid blueprint;
  hover panel + play-story.
- `infra/InfraGrid` — TanStack-Query backed 12-panel grid.
- `proofs/VerifyInBrowser` — the credibility-moment widget.
- `decision/DecisionList` + `decision/AgentEnsemblePanel` — filter
  + 7-agent side-by-side.
- `intel/CapitalFlowHeatmap` — asset × protocol matrix with
  per-cell provenance pills.
- `intel/ExposureGraph` — weighted SVG graph with counterfactual
  delta.

## Demo moments wired

| Moment | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Hero pulses + counters tick | `/` (HeroLattice + LiveCounter; Phase 24 swaps lattice for r3f globe) |
| Verify in browser → PASS | `/proofs/live` |
| /infra heatmap lights up under chaos lag | `/infra` (AttributionHeatmap component) |
| Defensive-mode rebalance with veto | `/decision-engine` featured rebalance |
| Paste-and-recommend flow | `/wallet-intelligence` |
| Hidden cross-protocol concentration | `/intelligence` exposure graph counterfactual |
| Architecture play-story | `/architecture` SystemDiagram |
| Playground first call → response → verify | `/playground` |

The legacy root-level `<Navbar />` retired in Phase 22 — every new
surface routes through one of the five Phase 21 shells.

# Frontend Part 4 — Operator Surfaces, Treasury OS, Confidential, Execution (Phase 23)

Phase 22 wins the first 30 seconds. Phase 23 wins the next 30 minutes.
Density discipline is the principle — every pixel earns its place.

## Owned routes

| Surface | Highlights |
|---|---|
| `/vaults` | Index of vaults the user has membership in + public vaults. Per-row band, TVL, APY, defensive/confidential/PER flags. |
| `/vault/[id]` | Vault Intelligence Terminal — `VaultStatusBar`, three-column allocation/performance/risk, last-rebalance card, agents sidecar, `BottomStrip` with `r p a ⌘.` shortcuts. |
| `/vault/[id]/rebalances` | Filterable rebalance list (regime / route / status / defensive). |
| `/vault/[id]/rebalances/[hash]` | Black-box record — outcome, decision, state diff, agent ensemble, CPI trace, timings funnel, **Verify in browser**. |
| `/vault/[id]/proofs` | Vault-scoped proof index with per-row Verify-in-browser. |
| `/vault/[id]/agents` | 7-card grid + drawer (mandate, features, training metadata, recent proposals). |
| `/vault/[id]/private/[session]` | PER session viewer — gated by viewing-key scope (none / agent-trace / post-hoc / realtime). |
| `/rebalance/live` | Four-quadrant Live Command Center: active rebalances · bundle status · latency timeline · network conditions. |
| `/triggers` + `/triggers/new` | Phase 12 proof-gated triggers; live `conditions_hash` in the wizard. |
| `/recurring` + `/recurring/new` | Adaptive DCA plans with cadence-history (each change a proof). |
| `/hedging` | Optional Perps hedge UI (open / close / resize all proof-gated). |
| `/treasury` | Treasury index cards. |
| `/treasury/new` | 11-step wizard — kind · multisig · KYB · template · band · risk policy · signers · confidential · private exec · review · sign. Live `strategy_commitment` hash. |
| `/treasury/[id]` | Treasury overview — KPIs, allocation across vaults, cashflow, upcoming payouts, recent ledger. |
| `/treasury/[id]/ledger` | Unified ledger with type filter and per-row Verify-in-browser. |
| `/treasury/[id]/runway` | Runway p10/p50, p10–p90 fan chart, signed drivers with provenance, "what if" sliders. |
| `/treasury/[id]/invoices` | Invoice intelligence + QVAC OCR overlay; image stays on device, only operator-confirmed fields submit. |
| `/treasury/[id]/payments` | Scheduled / pre-warming / settling / settled / failed states. |
| `/treasury/[id]/proofs` | Public-trust proof-of-reserve view with Verify-in-browser. |
| `/treasury/[id]/pending` | Squads queue + QVAC second-opinion analyst (recommendation, confidence, concerns matched against the failure-class catalog, fields-to-double-check). |
| `/treasury/[id]/confidential` | Disclosure-tier-aware view (PublicAuditor / Operator / FinanceAdmin / Recipient). Each unblind writes a Phase 14 I-17 audit row. |

## Operator primitives

`web/components/operator/`:
- `VaultStatusBar` — 40 px top strip: vault + treasury chips, slot, defensive / confidential / PER flags, alert count, connection status.
- `BottomStrip` — 32 px footer: pending count, last rebalance age, runway p10, keyboard hint cluster.
- `AllocationBar` — horizontal stacked bar with strategy-universe ghost segments; confidential-mode hides notionals.
- `Sparkline` — minimal SVG line for allocation history, performance windows, attribution.
- `RiskRadarMini` — 6-axis radar reused across vault and treasury surfaces.
- `AgentSidecar` — 7-agent confidence + veto rail.

Phase 23 retired the legacy flat routes (`vaults/`, `markets/`,
`proofs/`, `how-it-works/`); every operator surface now routes
through `(operator) / (treasury) / (governance)` route groups + the
Phase 21 `TerminalShell`.
